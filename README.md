Clarification Note
I would like to clarify that the project was developed using a different email ID than the one I registered with on AICTE.

Reason:
A few months ago, during my college coursework, I created an IBM Cloud account using my secondary email ID. Recently, I registered on AICTE using my primary email ID.

While working on this project, I continued using the IBM Cloud account associated with my secondary email ID, as it was already set up and functional. Throughout the development process, I did not encounter any errors or issues related to account usage.

This note is provided purely for transparency and clarification. I have also filled out the Google Form using my primary email ID (the one registered with AICTE).
